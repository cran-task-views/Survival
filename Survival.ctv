<info>
<p>Survival analysis, also called event history analysis in social science,
or reliability analysis in engineering, deals with time until occurrence
of an event of interest. However, this failure time may not be observed
within the relevant time period, producing so-called censored observations. 
</p>
<p>This task view aims at presenting the useful R packages for the analysis
of time to event data.</p>
<p>This is a preliminary task view, and we have likely missed some important 
information. Please email the task view maintener with any feedback.</p>


<h1>Standard Survival Analysis</h1>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Basic Methods:</b></em> The recommended package <pkg>survival</pkg> provides 
the necessary tools for estimating the distribution (survival probability) of time
to the event and cumulative hazards for various censoring 
and truncation schemes. <pkg>muhaz</pkg> allows estimation 
of the hazard function. Packages <pkg>eha</pkg> and <pkg>Design</pkg>
provide additional tools for dealing with time to event data,
like facilities to obtain risk sets or number of events.
<pkg>surv2sample</pkg> yields tests for comparing two survival
distributions. <pkg>TSHRC</pkg> provides a two-stage procedure
for comparing hazard rates. That is useful when hazard functions 
cross. Package <pkg>emplik</pkg> can performs empirical likelihood
for means, quantiles and hazards from possibly censored and/or truncated
data. Package <pkg>dblcens</pkg> computes the NPMLE estimator of CDF for 
doubly censored data, along with the CDF of the two censoring distributions.
  </li>

  <li><em><b>Cox Model:</b></em> <pkg>survival</pkg> permits to fit the well-known
Cox proportional hazards model for right-, left-, interval-censored
and counting process data. It can also be used with time-dependent
covariates. Goodness-of-fit tests are also implemented.
The <code>cph</code> function of the <pkg>Design</pkg> package
fits the Cox model for interval time-dependent covariates and  time-dependent
strata. <pkg>CPE</pkg> can use either a <code>coxph</code> or <code>cph</code>
object to evaluate the discriminatory power and the predictive accuracy of the model.
The <code>coxphf</code> function from <pkg>coxphf</pkg> package performs a Cox regression 
with Firth's penalized likelihood. This 
method has been shown to provide a solution in case of monotone likelihood.
<pkg>coxrobust</pkg> fits efficiently and robustly Cox models, but in its
basic form, that is without time-dependent covariates.
<pkg>intcox</pkg> fits a Cox model for interval censored data by the iterative 
convex minorant algorithm. The <pkg>NestedCohort</pkg> package permits to
display the Kaplan-Meier estimates of the survival probability
and to fit a Cox proportional hazards model for nested cohorts.
<pkg>survival</pkg> and <pkg>proptest</pkg> provides methods 
to test for the proportional hazards assumption.
  </li>

  <li><em><b>Other Regression Models:</b></em> 
The <pkg>survival</pkg> package proposes as a complement of 
the Cox model the <code>survreg</code> function, which fits linear
models for the mean of survival or its logarithm with various
parametric error distributions. Package <pkg>eha</pkg> implements
maximum likelihood estimation of proportional hazards models.
It reduces to a Cox model when there are no ties in the data.
This package also proposes the Weibull regression model. As for
the <pkg>Design</pkg> package, it contains an implementation of the
Buckley-James regression model. The <pkg>emplik</pkg> package also has
a function to compute the Buckley-James model, but without
intercept term. <pkg>rankreg</pkg> computes rank regression 
estimator for the accelerated failure time model and tests the coefficients against
a given value. <pkg>emplik</pkg> performs the same test through
empirical likelihood estimation. A conditional quantile regression
model for censored data can be fitted thanks to the <pkg>crq</pkg> package.
<pkg>lss</pkg> implements a recent inference procedure based
on the least-squares principle for the accelerated failure time model.
The generalized additive models for location, scale and shape (GAMLSS) can also
be fitted for censored data, and are implemented in the <pkg>gamlss.cens</pkg>
package. The <pkg>mixPHM</pkg> fits multiple mixtures of various parametric
hazard models using an EM algorithm. <pkg>smoothSurv</pkg> allows the fit
of a regression model with possible left-, right- and interval-censoring
and the error distribution expressed as a mixture of G-splines.
The <pkg>pseudo</pkg> package computes pseudo observations for
regressing survival function based on the restricted mean and
the Kaplan-Meier estimator.
The <pkg>tpr</pkg> package fits regression models for temporal
process responses with time-varying coefficients
<br />
The <pkg>timereg</pkg> package, not available on CRAN, contains
implementations of various models to deal with time-varying effects, like
the Aalen additive risk model, the semi-parametric additive risk model 
by McKeague and Sasieni, the Cox-Aalen model by Scheike and Zhang, 
the proportional excess hazards model by Martinussen and Scheike, 
the Cox model with partly time-varying effects by Martinussen, 
Scheike and Skovgaard, the two-stage estimation method for 
the Clayton-Oakes-Glidden model and the semiparametric proportional odds model.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Multistate Models</h1>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>General Multistate Models:</b></em>
The <code>coxph</code> function from package <pkg>survival</pkg> can be
fitted for any transition of a multistate model. It can also
be used for comparing two transition hazards, using correspondance
between multistate models and time-dependent covariates. Besides,
all the regression methods presented above can be used for multistate models
as long as they allow for left-truncation. <br />
The <pkg>mvna</pkg> package provides convenient functions for estimating
and plotting the cumulative transition hazards in any multistate model,
possibly subject to right-censoring and left-truncation.
<pkg>changeLOS</pkg> permits to estimate and plot the transition probabilties
for any multistate model. It also estimates the change of length of hospital
stay. 
The <pkg>msm</pkg> package contains functions for fitting general continuous-time
Markov and hidden Markov multistate models to longitudinal data. Transition rates 
and output processes can be modelled in terms of covariates.
  </li>

  <li><em><b>Recurrent Events:</b></em>
<code>coxph</code> from the <pkg>survival</pkg> can be used to 
analyze recurrent event data.
The <code>cph</code> function of the <pkg>Design</pkg> package fits the Anderson-Gill
model for recurrent events, model which can also be fitted with the
<pkg>frailtypack</pkg> package. The <pkg>survrec</pkg> package proposes
implementations of several models for recurrent events data, such as
the Pena-Strawderman-Hollander, Wang-Chang estimators, and MLE estimation 
under a Gamma Frailty model. The Pena-Hollander model can be fitted using
the <pkg>gcmrec</pkg> package. 
  </li>

  <li><em><b>Competing Risks:</b></em>
<pkg>surv2sample</pkg> provides estimation of the cumulative incidence
functions for several causes of failure. The package also performs comparison
in two samples. The package <pkg>cmprsk</pkg> also estimates the cumulative 
incidence functions, but they can be compared in more than two samples.
The package also implements the Fine and Gray model for regressing the
subdistribution hazards. Package <pkg>pseudo</pkg> computes pseudo observations
for modelling competing risks based on the cumulative incidence functions.
  </li>
</ul>
 
<h1>Relative Survival</h1>
  <p><pkg>relsurv</pkg> implements various regression models
used in relative survival, such as the additive model for 
relative survival with a binomial or a Poisson error, or the 
Andersen at al. multiplicative regression model, which is an 
extension of the Cox model for relative survival. It can also
fit the Cox proportional hazards model in transformed times. The 
package also includes display facilities and miscellaneous others.
  </p>

<h1>Multivariate Survival</h1>
<p> We mean by multivariate survival the analysis of unit,
e.g., the survival of twins or a family. To analyse 
such data, we can estimate the joint distribution of the 
survival times or use frailty models.</p>
<ul>
  <li><em><b>Joint Modelling</b></em>
Package <pkg>Icens</pkg> provides various implemention
of methods to find the NPMLE for censored and truncated
multivariate survival data. Note that some of these
techniques can be used for standard survival.
The package <pkg>MLEcens</pkg> permits to compute the nonparametric
maximum likelihood estimator for bivariate distributions when the 
failure times cannot be directly observed.
  </li>

  <li><em><b>Frailties:</b></em>
The <pkg>CompetingRiskFrailty</pkg> package fits a Cox model 
for each cause-specific hazards of competing risks data
with random effects and possible smooth varying coefficients.
<pkg>frailypack</pkg> fits a shared gamma frailty model using
a penalized likelihood on the hazard function for left-truncated
and censored data, with a maximum of two strata.
Joint models for survival data can be fitted using the <pkg>JM</pkg>
package. It can fit a Weibull accelerated failure time model,
an additive log cumulative hazard model or a time-dependent 
proportional hazards model. <pkg>kinship</pkg> implements 
a mixed-effects Cox model.
  </li>
</ul>

<h1>Bayesian Models</h1>
<p> <pkg>bayesSurv</pkg> package proposes an implementation
of several accelerated failure time models with random effects.
Parameter estimation is made using MCMC methods.
The package <pkg>DPpackage</pkg> includes a generic function
to fit a mixture of Dirichlet process in an accelerated failure
time model for interval censored data.
A proportional hazards model using a Bayesian approach is implemented
in package <pkg>survBayes</pkg>. Right- and interval-censored data
and a lognormal or gamma frailty term can be fitted.
</p>

<h1>Boosting techniques</h1>
<p> The <pkg>mboost</pkg> package includes a random forest 
and a generic gradient boosting algorithm for the construction
of prognostic and diagnostic models for right-censored data.
<pkg>CoxBoost</pkg> provides routines for fitting Cox proportional
hazards models by likelihood based boosting.
An extension of Random Forest techniques to right-censored data
can be found in <pkg>randomSurvivalForest</pkg>.
</p>

<h1>Other</h1>
<p> <pkg>KMsurv</pkg> includes the data sets and functions which
illustrates Klein and Moeschberger (1997), 
<q>Survival Analysis, Techniques for Censored and Truncated Data</q>, Springer-Verlag.
The package <pkg>boot</pkg> contains the function <code>bootcens</code>, which
performs various resampling plans for censored data.
<pkg>survivalROC</pkg> computes time-dependent ROC curve from censored
data using Kaplan-Meier or nearest neighbor estimation method.
The <pkg>TwoWaySurv</pkg> package fits an additive hazard model
for data where, besides the follow-time, a non-periodic calendar 
time is also taken into account.
